### Senior Design: Anit-Cheat Detection system
---
<br></br>

#### "Measure Learning" 
- Client Side Application
- Server Side Streaming
- UDP style streaming capabilites
- Camara Processing Capabilities
- Multithreading
- MIT / Free Licencing

#### Frameworks Ideas
- Flask
- React
- .NET MAUI

### Analysis/Training Methods
Scope: Monitoring features to begin with, and AI enhancements to further the focus of the models and feature. Increase accurcy and integrityare of the utmost concern.

### Market Research
- SSV
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/index.html)
- [FaceNet]
- [Deepface](https://research.facebook.com/publications/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/)
- [PyGaze](http://www.pygaze.org/about/)
    - this will allow for naive tracking, and will work on a computer that does not have a eyetracker
